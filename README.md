# Intermediate (cloud) certificate generation <a id='cloud_generation'></a>

To generate cloud certificates, you will need to use the `gen_cloud_certify.py` script with a configuration file. Before running this script, make sure you have all the dependencies installed.

To generate the certificates, follow these steps:

1. Obtain the root (`master.p12`) self-signed certificate.

2. Edit a configuration file named `config/cloud_certifi_req.json` with the following content:

```json
{
    "store_folder":         "generated_certificates/<cloud_name>/",
    "signing_cert_path":   "<path_to_master_cert>",
    "passcode":             "123456",

    "new_alias":            "<cloud_name>",
    "validity_period":      "10 years",
    "new_passcode":         "<passcode>",

    "cloud_operator":       "<cloud_operator>"
}
```

Here is what each option in the configuration file does:

 - `store_folder`: The folder where the generated certificates will be stored.

 - `signing_cert_path`: The path to the root (master) self-signed certificate.

 - `new_alias`:  The alias for the new cloud certificate.

 - `passcode`: The password for the root (master) self-signed certificate.
new_alias: The alias for the new cloud certificate.

 - `validity_period`: The validity period of the new cloud certificate (`N days/months/years`).

 - `new_passcode`: The password for the new cloud certificate.

 - `cloud_operator`: The name of the cloud operator.

3. Run the following command to generate the cloud certificates:



```bash
python gen_cloud_certify.py -p <path_to_config_file>
```
The `-p` option is optional and can be used to specify the path to the configuration file. If you do not use the `-p` option, the script will look for a file named `config/cloud_certifi_req.json`.

4. After running the command, the script will generate certificates in `store_folder`.



# End-entity (client) certificate generation <a id='client_generation'></a>

To generate client certificates, you will need to use the `gen_client_certify.py` script with a configuration file. Before running this script, make sure you have all the dependencies installed.

To generate the certificates, follow these steps:

1. Obtain the intermediate (cloud) self-signed certificate.

2. Edit a configuration file named `config/client_certifi_req.json` with the following content:

```json
{
    "store_folder":         "generated_certificates/<cloud_name>/",
    "signing_cert_path":    "generated_certificates/<cloud_name>/<new_alias_of_cloud_cert>",
    "passcode":             "<passcode_of_cloud_cert>",

    "clients": [
        {
            "new_alias":            "<client1_alias>",
            "validity_period":      "10 years",
            "new_passcode":         "<new_passcode>",
            "dns_names":            ["<SANdns1>", "<SANdns2>"],
            "ipv4_addresses":       ["<SANip1>", "<SANip2>"],
            "ipv6_addresses":       ["<SANip3>", "<SANip4>"]
        },
        {
            "new_alias":            "<client2_alias>",
            "validity_period":      "10 years",
            "new_passcode":         "<new_passcode>",
            "dns_names":            ["<SANdns1>", "<SANdns2>"],
            "ipv4_addresses":       ["<SANip1>", "<SANip2>"],
            "ipv6_addresses":       ["<SANip3>", "<SANip4>"]
        }
    ]

}
```

Here is what each option in the configuration file does:

 - `store_folder`: The folder where the generated certificates will be stored.

 - `signing_cert_path`: The path to the intermediate (cloud) certificate.

 - `passcode`: The password for the intermediate (cloud) certificate.

 - `new_alias`:  The alias for the new client certificate.

 - `validity_period`: The validity period of the new client certificate (`N days/months/years`).

 - `new_passcode`: The password for the new client certificate.

 - `dns_names`: DNS names for SAN.

 - `ipv4_addresses`: IPv4 addresses for SAN.

 - `ipv6_addresses`: IPv6 addresses for SAN.

3. Run the following command to generate the client certificates:


```bash
python gen_client_certify.py -p <path_to_config_file>
```
The `-p` option is optional and can be used to specify the path to the configuration file. If you do not use the `-p` option, the script will look for a file named `config/client_certifi_req.json`.

4. After running the command, the script will generate certificates in `store_folder`.




# Truststore generation <a id='truststore_generation'></a>

Truststore can be generated in two ways, described below.

## Truststore with Python script <a id='truststore_python'></a>
To generate cloud certificates, you will need to use the `gen_truststore.py` script with a configuration file. Before running this script, make sure you have all the dependencies installed.

`INFO`: You need to have installed `keytool` from Java.

To generate the certificates, follow these steps:

1. Edit a configuration file named `config/truststore_req.json` with the following content:

```json
{
    "store_folder":         "generated_certificates/<cloud_name>/",
    "signing_cert_path":    "generated_certificates/<cloud_name>/<new_alias_of_cloud_cert>",
    "passcode":             "<passcode_of_cloud_cert>",

    "new_alias":            "truststore",
    "new_passcode":         "<passcode>",

    "keytool_path":         "<path_to_keytool>"

}
```

Here is what each option in the configuration file does:

 - `store_folder`: The folder where the generated truststore will be stored.

 - `signing_cert_path`: The path to the intermediate (cloud) certificate.

 - `passcode`: The password for the intermediate (cloud) certificate.
new_alias: The alias for the new cloud certificate.

 - `new_alias`:  The alias for the truststore.

 - `new_passcode`: The password for the truststore.

 - `keytool_path`: Path to Java keytool.

2. Run the following command to generate the client certificates:


```bash
python gen_truststore.py -p <path_to_config_file>
```
The `-p` option is optional and can be used to specify the path to the configuration file. If you do not use the `-p` option, the script will look for a file named `config/truststore.json`.

3. After running the command, the script will generate certificates in `store_folder`.



## Truststore with KeyStore Explorer <a id='truststore_manual'></a>

You should follow [instructions](https://github.com/eclipse-arrowhead/core-java-spring/blob/master/documentation/certificates/create_trust_store.pdf).



# Extract PKCS12 certificate <a id='extract_pkcs12'></a>


This script loads a PKCS12 file (.p12) that contains a private key, a client certificate, and additional CA certificates. It then exports specified files: certificate, private key and (or) all additional CA certificates.

To generate seperate files, you will need to use the `extract_pkcs12_certs.py` script with a configuration file. Before running this script, make sure you have all the dependencies installed.

To generate the certificates, follow these steps:


1. Edit a configuration file named `config/truststore_req.json` with the following content:

```json
{
    "clients": [
        {
            "path":     "generated_certificates/<cloud_name>/",
            "alias":    "<client1_alias>",
            "passcode": "<passcode>",
            "ca":       true,
            "crt":      true,
            "key":      true

        },
        {
            "path":     "generated_certificates/<cloud_name>/",
            "alias":    "<client2_alias>",
            "passcode": "<passcode>",
            "ca":       true,
            "crt":      true,
            "key":      true

        }
    ]

}
```

Here is what each option in the configuration file does:

 - `path`: The folder where the folder of generated files will be stored.

 - `alias`:  The alias of client.

 - `passcode`: The password of the client certificate.

 - `ca`: If export additional CA certificates: true/false

 - `crt`: If export certificate: true/false

 - `key`: If export private key: true/false



2. Run the following command to generate the client certificates:


```bash
python extract_pkcs12_certs.py -p <path_to_config_file>
```
The `-p` option is optional and can be used to specify the path to the configuration file. If you do not use the `-p` option, the script will look for a file named `config/extract_pkcs12_req.json`.

3. After running the command, the script will generate certificates in `path/alias`.
